# Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression determines the relationship between dependent and independent variables.It is a statistical analysis which predicts values of dependent variables based on the values of the independent variables.

Consider equation of a straight line,

y = c + mx

where y is the dependent variable
c is a constant,
x is independent variable
m is an coefficient i.e. slope of the line.
.

We are going to use LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model library.To implement simple linear regression we are going to create a new dataset containing at least 30 records of year of experience and total salary.
